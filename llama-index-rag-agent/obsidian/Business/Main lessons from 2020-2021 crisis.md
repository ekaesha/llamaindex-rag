The COVID-19 recession, or the Global Lockdown, is a global crisis started in 2020. Many companies and businesses suffered from consequences of the pandemic, and had to reallocate their resources as well as adapting to the new reality. The main part of the economy that was affected by the recession was the unemployment rate, especially in areas that require physical workforce. Large companies had to reduce the number of workers in order to comply with sanitary regulations.

Nowadays the Pandemic is retreating. Many businesses have now learned a valuable lesson about distance work. Services like Zoom, Google Meet, online planning and task management tools helped people to stay connected. However, the other side of the online studying and working is productivity. People tend to have more distracting factors like household activities and family interactions that affect their concentration. That is why most of the companies are now trying to return people to office.

Another major lesson is connected with health. The pandemic showed that medical facilities were unable to handle this much of  patients. Today the vaccines and other health improvements have been successfully upgraded, and we are more ready to face potential disasters and other COVID-19 mutations.
